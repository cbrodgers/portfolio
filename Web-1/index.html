    <p>The most important goal of effective communication is clarity.
    Clarity is not the same as simplicity. Often, simple thing are clear 
    is about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a necessarily 
    large amount of data.
    </p>

    <div id="alert" class="alert"><p>This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective opragnization
        and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bit-sized"
        chunks of data, as simplification does.
    </p></div>

    <p>Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time,
        rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often 
        responsible for the "dumbing" of information rather than the illumination of it.
