  <h1>My Assessment</h1>
    <p>The most important goal of effective communication is clarity.
    Clarity is not the same as simplicity. Often, simple thing are clear 
    if the message is intended to be brief and small, but often the message
    is about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a necessarily 
    large amount of data.
    </p>
    <p>This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective opragnization
        and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bit-sized"
        chunks of data, as simplification does.
    </p>
    <p>Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time,
        rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often 
        responsible for the "dumbing" of information rather than the illumination of it.
    </p>
