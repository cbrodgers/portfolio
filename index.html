            <h3>Arkansas Dept of Higher Education Course Transfer System</h3>
            <p>In 2006, the Arkansas Legislature passed a law requiring that equivalent college courses are guaranteed to transfer to any state college in Arkansas.  The Academic Affairs division of the Arkansas Department of Higher Education (ADHE) was tasked with developing academic standards for over 100 courses and reviewing the syllabi of these courses at 32 colleges in Arkansas.  As the review process progressed, it became apparent that amount of paper-based data was rapidly overwhelming the staff.  As the newest member of the ADHE IT staff, it was my job to quickly sort out the academic review processes and develop a management system to facilitate capturing the academic review information.  A web based data entry system was quickly created, and the data was stored in a MS SQL database.  Reports were created to help ADHE staff identify missing course information.</p>
